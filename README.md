I'm an 18 year old innovator with over two years of paid full-time engineering and research experience; having started my first paid full-time junior engineer position at 15 years old. Iâ€™ve collaborated on large-scale projects with CEO's, investors, clients, analysts and managers of various business architectures; from high-pressure B2C startups to large-scale B2B engineering firms, my passion lies in quantitative finance, artificial intelligence, aerospace, and software engineering.
